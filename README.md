Level contains a lot of guards instead of 2 and each guard can drop ammo. In general the same thing as in requirement but from different side, i hope its ok.

Pickup weapon on the start and some ammo, there will be tutorial board as well.

I didn't remove some debug messages in the end, probably isn't critical but still...






[Honestly, very tired and this state of project probably final one coz i can polish it without stop]
